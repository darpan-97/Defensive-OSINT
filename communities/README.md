## Validation Checklist for Community Signal

**Before acting on claims from forums/discussions, verify:**

- [ ] **Source Credibility:** Is the author a known expert? Do they have track record?
- [ ] **Primary Source Evidence:** Do they link to official documentation or tool resources?
- [ ] **Peer Review:** Have other community members corroborated the claim?
- [ ] **Tool Currency:** Is the tool/technique still current? (Check last update date)
- [ ] **Legal/Ethical Clarity:** Does the claim include responsible-use caveats?
- [ ] **Cross-Reference:** Can you verify the same information from 2+ independent sources?

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Anonymous claims without evidence links
- ❌ Tools linked without official project pages
- ❌ Techniques described without methodology justification
- ❌ No mention of legal/ethical implications
- ❌ Single source (no corroboration)
